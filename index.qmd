## About This Project

Groundbreaking papers shouldn't just sit gathering dust. They deserve to be told as the incredible stories they are—stories of curiosity, clever detective work, and moments that changed everything we thought we knew.

We're a student-led platform making research accessible. From biology to AI, we explain the "why" and "so what" behind Nobel-worthy discoveries.
