## Our Mission

**eli5science** is a student-led platform making research accessible to everyone. We believe complex science should be explained simply—without dumbing it down.

## The Team

We're a group of students from India passionate about science communication. This project started as a way to share fascinating research stories with our peers and grew into a platform for collaborative learning.
