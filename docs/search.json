    "text": "Shinya Yamanaka and the four factors that revolutionized stem cell biology\nI’m currently reading Why We Die by Venki Ramakrishnan, and it got me thinking about one particular type of cell that technically never dies; stem cells. Here’s a mind-bending fact: the stem cells in your body right now are the same stem cells your great-great-great-ancestors had centuries ago. They’ve been passed down through generations, living through thousands of years. In a way, they’re the most immortal part of us.\nBut what if I told you that in 2006, a scientist figured out how to turn back time? Not in a sci-fi movie way, but in the cells of living organisms. That scientist was Shinya Yamanaka, and his discovery was so revolutionary that it won him a Nobel Prize just six years later.\nToday’s paper: “Induction of Pluripotent Stem Cells from Mouse Embryonic and Adult Fibroblast Cultures by Defined Factors” (2006)\nOr as I like to call it: The Time Machine! ⏰"

    "text": "The Challenge: Can You Turn Back the Clock?\nHere’s the setup. Your body contains about 200 different types of cells—skin cells, muscle cells, nerve cells, and so on. They all started from the same place: embryonic stem (ES) cells. These magical ES cells are like the ultimate “blank slate” that can become anything. They’re pluripotent, meaning they have the potential to become any cell type in your body.\nBut here’s the catch: once a cell decides what it wants to be when it grows up (a skin cell, say), it’s committed. It’s like choosing your college major—except way more permanent. The cell’s identity gets locked in through complex genetic and chemical changes.\nThe big question: Could you take an adult cell that’s already made its life choices and somehow convince it to become young again? To go back to being a stem cell?"

Got colonies that looked like ES cells\nRound 3: Removed factors one by one → Narrowed down to 10 essential ones\nRound 4: Further elimination → Identified THE FINAL FOUR suspects\n\nRemove any of these four, and you get nothing:\n\nOct3/4 – Master regulator of pluripotency\nSox2 – Oct3/4’s partner\nc-Myc – Powerful transcription factor (up to 25,000 genome binding sites!)\nKlf4 – Represses p53\n\nJust four factors to turn back the cellular clock.

It’s a reminder that sometimes the most elegant solutions are hiding in plain sight, waiting for someone brave enough to test them systematically.\nYamanaka didn’t just discover a technique. He proved that cellular identity is far more flexible than we ever imagined. He showed us that the passage of time, at least at the cellular level, might not be as one-way as we thought.\nEvery groundbreaking discovery starts with someone’s “what if?”\n\nWant to discuss this paper?

How do the players identify their teammates? Yes, one answer is their team colour! When they see the team colours, they know it’s their teammate, pass the ball, and trust that they’ll score a goal!\nNow, how do they know what colour their team is? Obviously, before the game, they see the colours and remember: this is our guy. Well, something similar also happens in our body. Have you ever wondered how our immune cells don’t attack our own cells? Is it because, during early development, they are exposed to self-cells, much like players seeing their team colours before the match? This was exactly the question asked by the British biologist Peter Medawar and his colleagues."

Importantly, these tolerant mice still rejected skin grafts from unrelated third-party strains, showing that the immune system was not generally suppressed."

Exposure to cells early in development teaches the immune system which cells belong to the body, just as a football player learns the team colours before the match. Early-exposed cells are treated as “self,” while new, unfamiliar cells are recognised as outsiders and rejected.\n“Indeed, first impressions truly do matter!”\nWhat our bodies see early on shapes how they respond for life, teaching the immune system to distinguish friend from foe, a lesson in recognition, memory, and trust that lasts a lifetime.

When a virus attacked, the bacteria would grab a piece of the virus’s DNA and store it in their own genome – like keeping a “wanted poster”. These stored fragments were arranged in a peculiar pattern: Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats – CRISPR.\nIf the same virus attacked again, the bacteria would recognize it and destroy it. It was adaptive immunity at the bacterial level. But nobody imagined this bacterial immune system could become the most powerful genome editing tool in history."

Like building new scissors from scratch every time you wanted to cut a different thread.\nEnter Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier.\nThey figured out exactly how the bacterial CRISPR system worked – and how to weaponize it for genome editing.\n\nThe Key Components:\n\nCas9 – The protein that cuts DNA (the scissors)\ncrRNA – Contains the “target address” (20 bases that match your target DNA)\ntracrRNA – Activates Cas9 and helps it work\nPAM sequence – A “NGG” DNA motif next to the target (like a safety lock)\n\nThe DNA only cuts when all four are present: Cas9 + crRNA + tracrRNA + Magnesium.\nThe game-changer? They showed you could combine crRNA and tracrRNA into one engineered guide RNA to direct Cas9 to cut any DNA sequence you wanted. They tested five different guide RNAs targeting five different sequences. All worked perfectly.\nThis paper is from 2012, and if you look at the figures, they’re filled with gel electrophoresis photos.

Yeast are just way easier to study, and not only autophagy but various other cellular processes too.\nThink of yeast as the lab rats of the cellular world, except smaller, cheaper, and you don’t need ethics approval.\n\nThe Cellular Recycling System\nBefore we dive in, let’s get the basics down. Inside your cells, there’s this whole network of organelles working together called the lysosomal endomembrane system. It includes:\n\nEndoplasmic Reticulum (ER) → the protein factory\nGolgi apparatus → the packaging center\n\nLysosomes → the recycling bins (in yeast, these are called vacuoles)\n\nWhen cells are starving or stressed, they need to recycle their own components to survive. That’s where autophagy kicks in. The cell wraps up bits of itself in a special membrane bubble called an autophagosome, which then fuses with a lysosome to form an auto-phago-lysosome. Inside this acidic environment, everything gets broken down and recycled.\nIn yeast, you can actually see this happening (another reason to choose yeast)! They form these structures called Autophagic Bodies (ABs) inside their vacuoles. And that’s what makes yeast so perfect for this research, you can literally watch the process under a microscope."

    "text": "The Hunt for Broken Mutants\nHere’s where it gets fun. The scientists asked themselves: “What if we find yeast that can’t do autophagy? That would tell us which genes are essential for the process!”\nSo they went mutant hunting.\n\nThe Experimental Design:\n\nStarve the yeast (nitrogen starvation, specifically) to trigger autophagy\nAdd PMSF (a chemical that stops the vacuole from breaking down the ABs) so they pile up and become visible\nLook under a microscope for yeast that DON’T form ABs\nThose are your mutants!\n\nThey found 15 different strains (named apg1 through apg15) that couldn’t form autophagic bodies. Each one had a single recessive mutation in a different gene. Fifteen genes! That’s how complex this system is."

    "text": "The Brilliant Microscopy Trick\nTo see the ABs clearly, they used a dye called quinacrine. The inside of the vacuole is acidic (just like lysosomes in our cells), and quinacrine loves acidic environments. So it lights up the vacuoles, making the ABs inside them super easy to spot.\nIn the wild-type yeast after starvation, the vacuoles would be packed with these glowing ABs. In the apg mutants? Nothing. Not even after 24 hours."

    "text": "The Takeaway: Your Cells Are Smarter Than You Think\nWhat makes this paper so important is that it proved autophagy isn’t just a random process. It’s a tightly controlled genetic program involving at least 15 different genes working together.\nWhen you skip meals, when you exercise, when you sleep; your cells are constantly making decisions about what to keep and what to recycle. Autophagy is how they clean house, remove damaged parts, and survive when nutrients are scarce.\nThis 1993 paper laid the groundwork for decades of research. The scientist who later won the Nobel Prize for autophagy research (Yoshinori Ohsumi, 2016) built directly on this foundation, identifying many more autophagy genes and showing how the process works in detail.\nSometimes the most important discoveries come from asking: “What breaks when we break this?”\n\nWant to discuss this paper?
